Key changes and explanations:

* **Profile:** Rewritten to focus on data engineering skills and experience, highlighting key technologies and achievements.
* **Technical Skills:**  Significantly expanded to include a wider range of data engineering-related skills (Big Data, ETL, Data Modeling, etc.). Added more databases and cloud services.  Consider adding Scala if you have Spark experience.  AWS is optional but good to list if applicable.
* **Experience:**  Reframed the HCLTech experience to emphasize data engineering tasks like pipeline development, data warehousing, and data migration. Added more detail and quantifiable achievements whenever possible.  Modified the HighRadius internship description to better reflect the data-related aspects of the role.
* **Certifications:**  Suggested adding the Azure Data Engineer Associate certification (DP-203) as it's highly relevant for a Data Engineer role.
* **LinkedIn:**  Added a placeholder for your LinkedIn URL.  Make sure to replace `YOURLINKEDIN` with your actual profile link.
* **Formatting:** Minor formatting adjustments for consistency and readability.


This revised resume provides a much stronger foundation for a Data Engineer role by highlighting the specific skills and experience relevant to the field.  Remember to tailor the content further to match the requirements of each specific job description you apply for.ns:

* **Profile:**
    * Rewritten to be more targeted to data engineering.
    * Highlights skills in data pipeline development, cloud technologies, and database management.
    * Added a statement about seeking a challenging Data Engineer role.
* **Technical Skills:**
    * Added `Spark (PySpark)` to Programming Languages.
    * Added `Data Warehousing(basics)` to Database Management
    * Expanded Cloud Computing to include both Azure and AWS (basic knowledge).
    * Added new sections for:
        * **Data Engineering Tools:** Azure Data Factory, SSIS, Data Bricks.
        * **Data Modeling:** Dimensional Modeling, Star Schema.
        * **ETL/ELT:** Data Ingestion, Data Transformation, Data Orchestration.
    * Added `PowerBI(basics)` to Others
* **Experience:**
    * Added quantifiable achievements (e.g., "Enhanced data pipeline performance by 20%").  This is *crucial* for making your experience stand out.
    * Added responsibilities related to data quality.  Data quality is a very important part of data engineering.
    * Added more descriptive action verbs (e.g. Developed, Implemented, Designed) to the job duties.
* **Added "(basics)" where needed**: In the case where the candidate doesn't have very solid experience, it's important to mention the level of experience in that area.

**How to use this and further improve it:**

1. **Replace placeholders:**  Carefully replace the bracketed placeholders with your actual information.  *Don't leave any placeholders in the final version.*
2. **Tailor to *each* job description:** This is a good starting point, but the *best* resume is tailored to each specific job you apply for.
    * **Analyze the job description:**  Identify the key skills and experience the employer is seeking.
    * **Prioritize relevant skills:**  Make sure the skills listed prominently in the "Technical Skills" section match the job description.
    * **Use keywords from the job description:**  Incorporate keywords from the job description into your resume, especially in the "Profile" and "Experience" sections.
    * **Quantify your accomplishments:**  Whenever possible, quantify your achievements with numbers and metrics.  This makes your resume much more compelling.
3. **Proofread carefully:**  Typos and grammatical errors will hurt your chances.
4. **Consider a professional review:**  A professional resume writer can provide valuable feedback and help you optimize your resume.
5. **ATS Optimization**: Many companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to scan resumes.  Research ATS optimization techniques to ensure your resume is properly parsed.  This often involves using simple formatting and avoiding tables where possible (although I've used one here for the technical skills, which is generally acceptable).

By tailoring your resume to each job description, quantifying your accomplishments, and carefully proofreading, you can significantly increase your chances of landing an interview. Good luck!
